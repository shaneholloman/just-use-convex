# just-use-convex

An AI-powered agentic chat platform built with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack). Multi-tenant, real-time, with Better Auth, Convex, Daytona sandboxes, vector search (RAG), and planning agents with sub-agents.

## Why This Template?

Skip weeks of boilerplate setup. This template provides:

- **Multi-organization auth out of the box** - Better Auth with org plugin, member invitations, and role-based access
- **Type-safe from database to UI** - Convex Ents for relationships + Zod validation throughout
- **Real-time by default** - Convex reactive queries with TanStack Query integration
- **Production patterns** - Pagination, aggregates, proper error handling, and authorization

## Features

### Authentication & Organizations
- Email/password authentication via Better Auth
- Multi-organization support with automatic personal org creation
- Team management within organizations
- Member invitation system (48-hour expiry)
- Role-based access control (owner/member)
- Session persistence with org/team context

### Backend Patterns
- **Convex Ents** - Entity relationships with type-safe queries
- **Zod validation** - Runtime schema validation on all inputs
- **Custom query helpers** - `zCustomQuery` and `zCustomMutation` with auth context
- **Aggregate system** - Real-time statistics via `@convex-dev/aggregate`
- **Pagination utilities** - Cursor-based pagination with infinite scroll support

### Documentation Site
Built-in documentation powered by Fumadocs:
- MDX content at `apps/web/content/docs/`
- Full-text search via `/api/search`
- Accessible at `/docs` route

### AI Agent
Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects for persistent chat state:
- **Planning agents** — VoltAgent Core with multi-step task decomposition and sub-agents
- **Daytona sandboxes** — PTY terminals, file ops, code interpreter per chat
- **Tools** — web search (Exa), ask-user (structured questions), vector RAG (Cloudflare Vectorize)
- **Streaming** — text-delta, reasoning-delta, tool-call, tool-result over WebSocket
- **Multi-model** — OpenRouter with configurable reasoning effort

### Demo Application
Includes a fully-featured todo app demonstrating all patterns:
- Kanban, list, and calendar views
- Multi-user assignment
- Priority and status filtering
- Team-scoped data
- Real-time statistics dashboard

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) v1.3.6 or later
- [Convex](https://convex.dev/) account (free tier available)
- [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) account (optional, for agent deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

2. Set up Convex:

```bash
bun run dev:setup
```

Follow the prompts to create a new Convex project.

3. Configure environment variables:

Copy environment variables from `packages/backend/.env.local` to `apps/web/.env`:

```bash
cp packages/backend/.env.local apps/web/.env
```

4. Set up JWKS for auth token validation:

```bash
cd packages/backend && bunx convex run auth:getLatestJwks | bunx convex env set JWKS
```

5. Start the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

7. Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser.
